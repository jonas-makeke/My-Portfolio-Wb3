Passionate about decentralization and active in the blockchain ecosystem since 2020, 
I specialize in community engagement, Web3 education, and the promotion of Cardano and Polkadot technologies. A key player in the Catalyst Project, I mobilize communities around decentralized innovation, particularly in Goma, DRC, where I lead initiatives to raise awareness and empower young talent. As a committed content creator, I explain complex Web3 concepts to make blockchain accessible to all.
